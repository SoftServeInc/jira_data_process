# Jira Project

## Description

An application was created to retrieve information from jira query and save it in the excel file.

The essence of the project is as follows: 
- it allows user to choose a jira (expedia, homeaway or any other) ✅; 
- it allows user to extract data from JIRA and write it to excel files such as xlsx ✅;
- it allows user to add new data in existing xlsx files, while allowing him to select the required fields (components, dates, labels, estimates and more) ✅.

All fields are validated on the UI part 📋. 
A project was written on React JS using server-client architecture. Several screenshots of the program were added below.
